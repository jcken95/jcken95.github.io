    "text": "I really like {beepr}. For the uninitiated, the usage is simply\n\nbeepr::beep()\n\nand the result of this code snippet is a beep. Literally a solitary beep. Quite useful when you have a medium length bit of code and want some kind of indication when it has finished. There are a handful of additional noises that can be accessed by placing a number in the function call.\nThese noises are all fine. But that’s it, they’re just fine. They’re not shocking, jarring, chilling or creepy. Where’s the fun in that?\nTurns out, if you do a bit of digging, the {beepr} package provides you with the functionality to play any .wav file that’s on your machine. This can be done with\n\nbeepr:::play_file(\"/path/to/noise.wav\")\n\nThat got me thinking. If I could collated some creepy .wav files I could probably make a creepy version of {beepr} before Halloween. Probably became a reality and in fact, going from this stupid idea to a working package only took a couple of hours (and I’d forgotten how to make a package)."

I’ve (to date) included a whopping 8 creepy sounds: “creature”, “eerie”, “intense”, “laugh”, “piano”, “piano2”, “ringing” and “strings”.\nA feature of this package is that, even if you close R whilst the sound is playing, the sound will not terminate with R. If you play a sound, then you’re committed to it. It’s like tops 15 seconds.\nHappy creeping!"
