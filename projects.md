### [Handling Uncertainty in a Stochastic Wind Farm Simulator](/assets/squares-talk.pdf) 
I present an overview of a stochastic offshore wind farm simulator and outline some of the uncertainties associated with computer modelling. I also talk about some of the best practices to sensitivity analysis and apply senstivity analysis to the wind farm simulator using the techniques presented by [Marrel et al. (2012)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11222-011-9274-8).

### [Stochastic Multilevel Emulation](/assets/ccc.pdf) 
This talk outlines an approch to emulation of stochastic computer models when cheap approximations are available. It is an extension of [Predicting the Output from a Complex Computer Code When Fast Approximations Are Available](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2673557?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents).

### [Uncertainty Quantification for Offshore Wind](/assets/rss-belfast.pdf)
Here I give an overview of my PhD topic: using Gaussian Process emulators to facillitate efficient analysis of a stochastic offshore windfarm simulation.
