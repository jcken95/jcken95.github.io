For the uninitiated, the usage is simply\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbeepr::beep()\n```\n:::\n\n \nand the result of this code snippet is a beep. Literally a solitary beep. Quite useful when you have a medium length bit of code and want some kind of indication when it has finished. There are a handful of additional noises that can be accessed by placing a number in the function call.\n\nThese noises are all *fine*. But that's it, they're just *fine*. They're not shocking, jarring, chilling or creepy. Where's the fun in that?\n\nTurns out, if you do a bit of digging, the {beepr} package provides you with the functionality to play any `.wav` file that's on your machine. This can be done with\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbeepr:::play_file(\"/path/to/noise.wav\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThat got me thinking. If I could collated some creepy `.wav` files I could _probably_ make a creepy version of {beepr} before Halloween. Probably became a reality and in fact, going from this stupid idea to a working package only took a couple of hours (and I'd forgotten how to make a package). \n\n## Get creeping\n\nI've put the package on github, thus you can install and run {creepr} in the following way\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndevtools::install_github(\"https://github.com/jcken95/creepr\")\ncreepr::creepr()\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis will play a sound from my collated sounds at random. I've (to date) included a whopping 8 creepy sounds: \"creature\", \"eerie\", \"intense\", \"laugh\", \"piano\", \"piano2\", \"ringing\" and \"strings\". \n\nA feature of this package is that, even if you close R whilst the sound is playing, the sound __will not__ terminate with R. If you play a sound, then you're committed to it. It's like tops 15 seconds.\n\nHappy creeping!\n",
