### [Advanced LaTeX](/assets/latex-course/latex-slides.pdf) 
Here are the slides for the LaTeX course I delived to postgraduate students at Newcastle University. The slides are originally by my friend [Jack Walton](https://jwalton.info), who previously delivered the course. I've made a few tweaks, but credit is mainly to him. The material is aimed at people who have a decent working knowlegde of LaTeX but want improve their workflow and produce higher quality documents.
