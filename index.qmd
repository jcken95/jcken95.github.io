I'm  Jack, a statistician, data scientist and educator based in the north east. Nice to meet you.

My currently a data scientist at [Jumping Rivers](https://www.jumpingrivers.com). I completed all my studies at Newcastle University. I hold a PhD in Statistics (2023) and also obtained a First class MMathStat (2018).

From a professional perspective, I love telling stories with data, learning about how to write production-ready software, anything remotely statsy and finding a data-driven solution to challenging problems. I'm donated a lot of my time to the [Royal Statistical Society](rss.org.uk); serving and chairing the Young Statisticians Section and I'm also treasurer or the North Eastern local group.

When I'm not doing massive nerd stuff I'm probably doing some type II fun. I fill my free time with cycling, running and walking the dog. The dog is called Robin and I don't know what breed he is.
