<p>Here are the slides for the LaTeX course I delived to postgraduate students at Newcastle University. The slides are originally by my friend <a href="https://jwalton.info">Jack Walton</a>, who previously delivered the course. Iâ€™ve made a few tweaks, but credit is mainly to him. The material is aimed at people who have a decent working knowlegde of LaTeX but want improve their workflow and produce higher quality documents.</p>
