<p>I present an overview of a stochastic offshore wind farm simulator and outline some of the uncertainties associated with computer modelling. I also talk about some of the best practices to sensitivity analysis and apply senstivity analysis to the wind farm simulator using the techniques presented by <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11222-011-9274-8">Marrel et al. (2012)</a>.</p>

<p>This talk outlines an approch to emulation of stochastic computer models when cheap approximations are available. It is an extension of <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2673557?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents">Predicting the Output from a Complex Computer Code When Fast Approximations Are Available</a>.</p>

<p>Here I give an overview of my PhD topic: using Gaussian Process emulators to facillitate efficient analysis of a stochastic offshore windfarm simulation.</p>
