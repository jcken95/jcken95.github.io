### [Stochastic Multilevel Emulation](/assets/ccc.pdf) 
This talk outlines an approch to emulation of stochastic computer models when cheap approximations are available. It is an extension of [Predicting the Output from a Complex Computer Code When Fast Approximations Are Available](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2673557?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents)

### [Uncertainty Quantification for Offshore Wind](/assets/rss-belfast.pdf)
This talk gives an overview of my PhD topic: using Gaussian Process emulators to facillitate efficient analysis of a stochastic offshore windfarm simulation.
