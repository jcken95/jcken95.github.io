### [Decision Support for Large Offshore Wind Farms via Bayesian Optimisation](/assets/spares-decision.pdf)
I present a unification of Bayesian Optimisation and Decision Support to solve decision problems with a complex parameter space. The approach is motivated by decision making for a logistical problem in offshore wind farms; storing a sufficient number of spare parts to ensure a smooth running of the wind farm and to keep uptime high whilst keeping costs low.

### [Handling Uncertainty in a Stochastic Wind Farm Simulator](/assets/squares-talk.pdf)
I present an overview of a stochastic offshore wind farm simulator and outline some of the uncertainties associated with computer modelling. I also talk about some of the best practices to sensitivity analysis and apply senstivity analysis to the wind farm simulator using the techniques presented by [Marrel et al. (2012)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11222-011-9274-8).

### [Stochastic Multilevel Emulation](/assets/ccc.pdf)
This talk outlines an approch to emulation of stochastic computer models when cheap approximations are available. It is an extension of [Predicting the Output from a Complex Computer Code When Fast Approximations Are Available](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2673557?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents). This talk has been was given as a seminar talk at Stats4Grads, Durham University 2020.

### [Uncertainty Quantification for Offshore Wind](/assets/rss-belfast.pdf)
Here I give an overview of my PhD topic: using Gaussian Process emulators to facillitate efficient analysis of a stochastic offshore windfarm simulation. This talk has been presented at Risk Day 2019, The Reseach Students' Conference in Probability and Statistics 2019 and The Royal Statistical Society's annual conference 2019.
