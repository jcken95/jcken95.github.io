I'm a statistician based in the north east. Nice to meet you.

An existential crisis lead to me purging my old website. Welcome to the new me.

When I'm not doing massive nerd stuff I'm probably either out on my bike, out with the dog, cleaning the bike or cleaning the dog. The dog is called Robin and I don't know what breed he is.
